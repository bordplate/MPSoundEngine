This `MPSoundEngine`-fork allows you to very easily synthesise sounds for mono or stereo output on iOS.

## Usage
`MPSoundEngine` is designed to be as easily usable as possible. There are two concrete subclasses,
`MPMonoSoundEngine` and `MPStereoSoundEngine`. You interact with them through `MPSoundChannel` objects.

This project also includes an example. To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

### Mono Sound
Here's how to synthesise the musical note A as a mono signal.

    #import <MPSoundEngine/MPMonoSoundEngine.h>
    MPMonoSoundEngine *engine = [[MPMonoSoundEngine alloc] init];
    engine.channel.frequency = 440.0; // 440 Hz is the musical note A
    [engine start];

### Stereo Sound
Here's how to synthesise the musical note A on the left channel and the musical note C on the right channel as a stereo signal.

    #import <MPSoundEngine/MPStereoSoundEngine.h>
    MPStereoSoundEngine *engine = [[MPStereoSoundEngine alloc] init];
    engine.leftChannel.frequency = 440.0; // 440 Hz is the musical note A
    engine.rightChannel.frequency = 261.00; // 261 Hz is the musical note C
    [engine start];

## Installation
MPSoundEngine-iOS is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "MPSoundEngine", :git => "git@github.com:bordplate/MPSoundEngine.git"
